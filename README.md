# Alien Siege: Turret Defense

A modern arcade turret defense shooter inspired by the fixed-turret loop of *Paratrooper*, reskinned as an alien invasion defense game.

> **Resuming development?** Read [`docs/PROJECT_MEMORY.md`](docs/PROJECT_MEMORY.md) for phase history, architecture, and current state. AI agents should also read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
cd alien-siege
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Controls (Phase 1)

| Action | Desktop |
|--------|---------|
| Aim | Mouse (or `A`/`D`, arrow keys) |
| Fire | Left click or `Space` |
| Pause | `Esc` |
| Menu confirm | `Enter` |

## Architecture Summary (Phase 1)

- **React** owns the app shell: title screen, pause overlay, HUD containers.
- **HTML5 Canvas** renders all gameplay via a fixed logical resolution (1280×720), scaled to fit the viewport.
- **`Game`** class orchestrates update/render, owns session state, and communicates with React through callbacks.
- **`GameLoop`** uses `requestAnimationFrame` with delta-time updates (capped at 30 FPS minimum step).
- **`InputManager`** normalizes mouse/keyboard into a single `InputState`.
- **`Turret`** rotates toward aim target with clamped firing arc; **`EntityManager`** + object pool handle projectiles.
- **`Renderer`** composes background, projectiles, muzzle flashes, and turret layers.

## Balancing Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/game/data/balancing.ts` | Global constants (canvas size, base health, combo, waves) |
| `src/game/data/turretConfig.ts` | Turret rotation + Machine Gun weapon stats |
| `src/game/data/enemies.ts` | Enemy type definitions (HP, speed, patterns, score) |
| `src/game/data/levels.ts` | Level wave schedules and bonuses |
| `src/game/data/credits.ts` | Credit earn rates (kills, waves, boss, bonuses) |

## Current Status — Phase 6 Complete

- [x] Phases 1–5: Combat, defense, levels, mothership boss
- [x] **Credits** as spendable currency separate from arcade **score**
- [x] Earn credits from kills, wave clear, boss defeat, level complete
- [x] Optional accuracy and low-breach performance bonuses
- [x] HUD credits display; level-end summary screen with full breakdown

### Next Phases

- Phase 7: Between-level shop + upgrades
- Phase 8: Polish (particles, audio hooks, balance pass)
